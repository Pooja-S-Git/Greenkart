Automation of GreenKart Application

Introduction: GreenKart is a demonstration website commonly used for automation testing purposes. It features a dashboard, top deals section, flight booking functionality, and allows users to browse items. Users can add items to their cart and adjust quantities accordingly. (https://rahulshettyacademy.com/seleniumPractise/#/)

Objective: This project aims to automate various functionalities of the GreenKart website using Selenium WebDriver and Cucumber framework. The automation script covers scenarios for browsing items, adding them to the cart, and modifying quantities.

Setup: To run the automation script, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (Selenium WebDriver, Cucumber, etc.).
Configure the project to point to the GreenKart website.
Execute the automation script using the provided feature files.
Project Structure: The project structure consists of the following components:

Feature Files: Each scenario is defined in a separate feature file, outlining the steps to be executed.

Step Definition: Step definitions correspond to the steps outlined in the feature files. They contain the actual automation logic.

Page Factory: Page factory classes are used to initialize web elements and define methods to interact with them.

Generic Methods: Generic methods provide reusable functionality across different scenarios, promoting code efficiency and maintainability.

How to Use:

Identify the scenario you want to execute from the feature files.
Navigate to the corresponding step definition and ensure it aligns with your scenario requirements.
Run the automation script and observe the execution.
Analyze the test results to verify the functionality of GreenKart.
